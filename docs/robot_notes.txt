QR Codes:

from PIL import Image
from pyzbar.pyzbar import decode
data = decode(Image.open('test1.png'))
print(data)

Hardware:

Front left wheel does not drive forward. Backward works fine. We suspect this is either an issue with the motor gearbox or the motor controller.

Networking:

The robot is connected to the Etown Guest wifi, but this connection is limited and slow. A phone hotspot seems to work better.
