from pyzbar.pyzbar import decode
data = decode(Image.open('test1.png'))
print(data)

Hardware:

Front left wheel does not drive forward. Backward works fine. We suspect this is either an issue with the motor gearbox or the motor controller.

Update:

The robot raspberry pi 4 SD card corrupted, causing us to need to flash a new card and effectively reverting a chunk of our progress. We then could not get this pi to boot a new SD card inside the robot. A second raspberry pi was purchased and has replaced the original pi.

The wheel is still broken. We eliminated the motor as being at fault by swapping it for another motor from a working corner of the robot. This seems to confirm the robot's motor driver board has a fault, but we have not been able to test movement with the new raspberry pi and new control software.

Networking:

The robot is connected to the Etown Guest wifi, but this connection is limited and slow. A phone hotspot seems to work better.
