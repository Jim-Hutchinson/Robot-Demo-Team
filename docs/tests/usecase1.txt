Use Case #1: Successfully Recognize Product by QR

Step 1. Clone and open Robot-Demo-Team in VS Code (github link: https://github.com/Jim-Hutchinson/Robot-Demo-Team).

Step 2. Setup a db_config.py file with proper configurations in data_src (if not already created).

Step 3. Run qrcode_generator.py in data_src and enter an ID to create a QR code with the same ID as the product you want.

Step 4. Run robot_main.py in data_src and select the desired product with matching ID
List: 
    ID 1=Peaches
    ID 2=Bananas
    ID 3=Pears
    ID 4=Apples
    ID 5=Kumquat

Step 5. Put the generated QR code in front of the camera opened using robot_main.py

Step 6. If successful, the camera will close and print the product and its ID into the terminal.
