This is just a temporary folder to hold all of the files in the FTP server in the git, the config has not been copied, you will have to manually move that over to your local machines.

The purpose of this folder is to have a place for the files while we organize them into their respective folders, and also to be able to make changes to them on our local machines as well as on GIT without affecting the server. When moving files into data or web src folders, make sure to change any references to said files in any other files to reflect the movement!
